I chose JavaScript for this project and focused on the MERN stack to streamline things. It was a bit of a learning curve, especially 
diving into the backend with Node.js.

Given more time, I would have made this fully functional on github pages, so that local running wouldn't be required. The UI would 
be much more expanded on with elements like search and sorting functions. I would have made pages to create, edit and delete cheeses. 
Searching and sorting would be implemented into the backend for larger datasets and scalability. In this case, images were stored on 
the frontend for simplicity but a cloud service like Amazon S3 could've been used to store and retrieve these images.

Overall this project was quite simple, but getting unit tests to work properly and ensuring MongoDB was functional took far too much
time. It wouldn't take me even half the time to do all of this again with the experience I've picked up solely from this exercise.
